# Microfocus test, Matan Avraham

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

1. Unzip the project then open terminal on the project folder.
2. Run 'npm install' command on terminal to install relevant packages.
3. Run 'npm start' command on terminal in order to run locally.

Unfortunately, I have completed only the second bonus due to lack of a time. not any known problems.
Thanks for the opportunity!
